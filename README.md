### Inspiration:

This project was inspired by one of our first assignments in class creating a to-do 
list as well as the common struggles in a college student life in time management.

I wanted to create a project where students will be able to digitally create an easy
method to keep on track of things they need to do. I wanted to include a calender, a 
timer, and a to-do list. However I was only able to complete 1 out of the 3 goals of 
the project.

### Barriers

Some barriers I faced were my lack of knowledge in programming as well as the limited
Time I could invest in this projects. It has taken me considerable time to learn and
create this project.
